      Hi Jenna!<br><br>
      These are just some thoughts that I have that I don't really know if I'll be able to say to you aloud- or maybe it's just a sketchpad to figure out my feelings idk. <br> <br>

      This page doesn't really have a script. I don't know what I'll write about and what I'll be thinking.

      <h2 class="entry-title">Thoughts on 6/26</h2>
      I feel... Shitty. Like, really shitty. And I know I shouldn't! I know this entire thing was supposed to be whatever, it was supposed to be unplanned and chill and I shouldn't have any expectations. Honestly, I feel really stupid. Like a complete sucker. I guess I just thought that asking me to walk you home was a veiled invitation for me to come over to your place. I don't know, that's the natural thing to think right? And then in the middle of it all, you just turned me down. And honestly, it hurts so much Jenna. I know it shouldn't but wow I'm lying here in bed thinking about what happened and it just really really hurts. <br><br>
      And then there's Thursday. Honestly, I think I'm allowed to be a bit pissed about this one. Turning me down and going home is fine- like it hurt me a lot, but I should have gone in with no expectations. But Thursday. Really Jenna? Like, it really shows me how little you care when you just casually plan over us like that. I told you that I was going to check, and then the next day I got back to you and said that I had moved climbing! And yet you still just made plans instead. That one hurts, and it's a bit infuriating. I don't know. This really sucks. I want to take space away from you because it just feels so shitty right now. <br><br>
      Good night. I'm... upset. But I still wish you were next to me, as much as I hate to admit it.
