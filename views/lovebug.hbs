  My dearest Jenna, my lovebug, my girlfie, <br><br>

    It's hard for me to write these words- in fact, I don't even know where to start. <br>
    I woke up today with a heart that ached so badly it threatened to burst out of <br>
    my chest. It's a different kind of pain, the crippling kind that made me want to curl <br>
    up into a ball and cry cry cry it out. It feels like without you, I suddenly became lost<br>
    in this empty world. You are my other half. Without you, I don't feel complete. <br><br>
    To be honest, I think it's still hitting me. Slowly, certainly, it is hitting me with the <br>
    magnitude that you're no longer mine. I've cried so much and hurt so much- I don't know <br>
    if I can accept that you're gone.<br><br>
    I love you so much, Jenna. I gave you my everything, I tried so hard to make you happy. <br>
    And now, I understand that it was too much. I'm so angry- angry at myself for not seeing it<br>
    angry at the situation for punishing me so. I reflect back on my behavior as a boyfriend and <br>
    I just... I can say that I really really really did try. I did everything to make you happy, <br>
    and in the end, perhaps that was my downfall. And at the end of the day, I guess I can say that <br>
    that means I don't have regrets. If I was able to make you happy in this past year, then of course<br>
    it was all worth it for you. <br> <br>

    But my god. My god it hurts so much. It hurts so so much. I don't know why I'm even writing this- <br>
    I vowed that after I break up I would do everything in my power to minimize your hurt. I know how <br> 
    guilty you must feel for breaking my heart and causing me pain. I know that feeling, and I know <br>
    you're hurting over there too. I guess maybe I'm just selfish, maybe I want to share with you so <br>
    you can feel the hurt I'm feeling. Maybe I just suck. But wow. I am crushed. <br><br>

    You are my everything. This letter, this photo gallery, it was all my way of coping with <br>
    the fact that we're no longer together. To be honest, I really really thought I was the boy <br>
    for you. I really did. And to see it all gone truly crushes me. But love comes with trust, and <br>
    I trust that you made the right decision. Even if it hurts me now, to the point where I can't even <br>
    begin to process this breakup to its entirety, I can stick to the fact that I treated you in the best <br> way that I could have, and at the end of the day, I have loved every second of this time with you. <br> <br>

    I love you Jenna. I love you, I love you, I love you. I honestly don't know what's going to happen. <br> 
    I'm at a loss- I'm completely confused and just... Everything is shut down. My brain is on autopilot <br>
    mode. I can't think straight. I know you know me as someone who can think clearheaded even when it's <br>
    hard, but with you lovie, with you I can't, I just can't handle this hurdle right now. It'll take time, <br>but all I can cling on to are the memories that we had. <br>
    All the times I rubbed your nose, brushed your hair out of your face, all the times you fit under my <br>
    in that little nook, I think back to those and cry, cry, cry. Cry tears of happiness, tears of saddness<br>
    It's all so bittersweet. I am so thankful to you for giving me this time with you, but at the <br>
    same time I'm so fucking sad that it's over. <br>  <br>

    I hope you find what you are looking for. I really do. I don't know what else to write <br>
    to be honest, I haven't thought through it all yet just because it's too painful and I don't <br>
    think my mind is ready for it. But I do know that I still love you and want all the best for you. <br><br><br>

    Take care, my lovebug.<br>
    Yours, <br><br>
    Alex
